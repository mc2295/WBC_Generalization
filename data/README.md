Introduce here the images coming from the publicly available datasets. The names of the classes as well as the names of the images should remain the same as they are in their original paper. The file structure must be

```
data
|__name_dataset
|  |__name_class_1
|       image1.png
|       image2.png
```

For instance

```
data
|__matek_2018
|  |__BAS
|       BAS_0001.tiff
|       BAS_0002.tiff
```
